 evalType  : specifies how this evaluation is made.  One of the following (required)
               HIGH - want to maximize the area within the range defined by the bounds (low values indicate scarcity)
               LOW  - want to minimize the area within the range defined by the bounds (high values indicate scarcity)
 
 method    : specifies how the calcualtion is made.  One of the following (required)
               AREAWTMEAN - compute an area-weighted mean value
               
 lowerBound: the lower bound for this attribute, expressed in total area or percent area, depending on the valueof the "area" attribute (required)
 upperBound: the upper bound for this attribute, expressed in total area or percent area, depending on the valueof the "area" attribute (required)
 
 
 Autonomous Processes
   
   name (required)     name of model
   id   (required)     id specified in ENVX file
   col  (optional)     database field name for process to populate
   value (optional)    computed value to populate into database
   query (optional)    spatial query limiting scope of computation (ignored if useDelta specified)
   constraints (optional)
   useDelta  (optional) instead of iterating through map, iterate though delta array.   In this case
                        usedelta must contain a field=value pair to look for in the delta array.
   network_layer (required) the name of the layer to use for the network representation.
   network_method (required) = "CMB", "CS", "ES"
   index_col (optional) column in IDU coverage that contains the index of the network edge its is associated with
   network_col (optional) column in network coverage to populate with results
   to_col   = specifies column in the database that has pointers to the "to" (downstream) edges from this node  (only one of "to_col" or "from_col" is required)
   from_col = specifies column in the database that has pointers to the "from" (upstream) edges from this node (only one of "to_col" or "from_col" is required)
   edge_col (optional)  column in database that containes the to/from references. if to/from references contain index of target edge, then this should not be specified   
   treeid_col (optional)  column in database to store witch network tree this is
   order_col (optional)   column in network coverage to populate with network order number
   flow_col (required if network_method = cmb) column in network coverage containing flow information
