 evalType  : specifies how this evaluation is made.  One of the following (required)
               HIGH - want to maximize the area within the range defined by the bounds (low values indicate scarcity)
               LOW  - want to minimize the area within the range defined by the bounds (high values indicate scarcity)
 
 method    : specifies how the calcualtion is made.  One of the following (required)
               AREAWTMEAN - compute an area-weighted mean value
               
 lowerBound: the lower bound for this attribute, expressed in total area or percent area, depending on the valueof the "area" attribute (required)
 upperBound: the upper bound for this attribute, expressed in total area or percent area, depending on the valueof the "area" attribute (required)
 
 
 Autonomous Processes
   
   name (required)     name of model
   id   (required)     id specified in ENVX file
   col  (optional)     database field name for process to populate
   value (optional)    computed value to populate into database
   query (optional)    spatial query limiting scope of computation (ignored if useDelta specified)
   constraints (optional)
   useDelta  (optional) instead of iterating through map, iterate though delta array.   In this case
                        usedelta must contain a field=value pair to look for in the delta array.
