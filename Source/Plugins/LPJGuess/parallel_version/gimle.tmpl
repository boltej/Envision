#
# Portable bash script to run LPJ-GUESS version:
# BINARY
# as a parallel job using SLURM.
#
# Created automatically on DATE
# 
# Usage: 
#
#   1. Copy script to the directory where you want output written.
#      This will be called the RUN DIRECTORY.
#   2. In an editor, set appropriate values for the variables NPROCESS,
#      INSFILE, GRIDLIST and OUTFILES (NB: no space after the = sign):

NPROCESS=15
WALLTIME=150:00:00
INSFILE=guess.ins
INPUT_MODULE=cru_ncep
GRIDLIST=gridlist.txt
OUTFILES='*.out'

#      Where:
#      NPROCESS     = number of processes in parallel job
#      WALLTIME     = maximum wall (real) time for job hh:mm:ss
#      INSFILE      = path to ins file from run directory
#      INPUT_MODULE = input module to use
#      GRIDLIST     = path to gridlist file from run directory
#      OUTFILES     = list of LPJ-GUESS output files in single quotes,
#                     and separated by spaces (filenames only, including
#                     extension, no directory.) Shell wildcards are allowed.
#
#   3. Run the script using the command:
#        ./submit.sh
#      or:
#        ./submit.sh [-n <name>] [-s <file>] [-i <ins-file>]
#
#      All arguments are optional and interpreted as:
#      name     = the name of the job (shown in PBS queue)
#      file     = filename of a file which can override the variables
#                 above
#      ins-file = instruction file to use, overrides the INSFILE
#                 variable above
#
# Nothing to change past here
