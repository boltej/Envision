  transition deltas is a binary switch that when set equal to 1 will create an attribute
  in the IDU layer named "VEGTRANTYPE" during Init.  During run time a delta will be
  sent to the delta array everytime DynamicVeg implements a LULC_C transition. If set 
  equal to 0, nothing will happen
  
  Delta array values:
  0 - is the default set before a run
  1 - Successional AGECLASS deterministic transition
  2 - Successional probabilistic transition
  3 - Disturbance transition

  <!--if either the AGECLASS or TSD attributes in the IDU layer need to be
      initialized before first Envision time step, then set equal to 1.  If 
      set equal to 0, then it is assumed that the user has initialized these 
      attributes with another method
      
      if 1 is set for age_class_initializer, then AGECLASS will be intialized in the IDU layer
      with a uniformally distributed random AGECLASS value between the STARTAGE and 
      ENDAGE in the Deterministic Lookup file.
      
      if 1 is set for tsd_initializer, then TSD will be intialized in the IDU layer
      by the following equation.  Values for this equation are found in the Probability
      lookup table. Random TSD is calcualted based on a uniform distribution between TSD
      and TSDMAX.
        TSD = (random AGECLASS) - MINAGE     as found in determinsitic lookup table-->
